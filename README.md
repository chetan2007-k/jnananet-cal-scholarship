# JnanaNet – Cognitive Access Layer (CAL)
### AI for Bharat Hackathon 2026 – Prototype Phase

## 🚀 Project Overview

JnanaNet is a working prototype of a Cognitive Access Layer (CAL) designed to simplify scholarship application workflows for students with low digital literacy.

Instead of expecting students to navigate complex government portals, JnanaNet adapts digital workflows into step-by-step, language-aware, and literacy-aware guidance.

This prototype demonstrates how AI can make public digital systems more inclusive and accessible.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite rapid digitization of government services in India, millions of students struggle to access scholarship portals due to:

- Language barriers
- Low digital literacy
- Complex application workflows
- Poor connectivity
- Confusing documentation requirements

Existing systems assume technical understanding and digital familiarity, leading to exclusion and unequal access to financial aid.

There is a need for a Cognitive Access Layer that adapts digital systems to human capability rather than forcing citizens to adapt to technology.
